# Trail Teller

Trail Teller is a web application built with TypeScript and Node.js, designed to run with Docker using a multi-service setup (e.g., backend API and database).  
This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for running the backend directly without Docker)

---

## Getting Started (Recommended: Docker Method)

This is the recommended way to run the project because everything is already configured with Docker and Docker Compose.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kittikanning/TrailTeller.git
cd TrailTeller
